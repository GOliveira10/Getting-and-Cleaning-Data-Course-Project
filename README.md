# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:
This is my take on the course project for the third course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science track: "Getting and Cleaning Data." It takes several txt files from a messy set of gyroscopic data gathered from smartphones, spins it together into a clean data table, extracts only mean and std information out of the variety of data available, then outputs a tidy data set with all columns clearly labeled and observations associated with the proper subjects.

*plyr is required*
